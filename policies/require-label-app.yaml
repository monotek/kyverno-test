      Define and use labels that identify semantic attributes of your application or Deployment.
      A common set of labels allows tools to work collaboratively, describing objects in a common
      manner that all tools can understand. The recommended labels describe applications in a way
      that can be queried. This policy validates that the label `app` is specified with some value.
